# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Overview the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard, a company with several thousand employees, for the upcoming “silver tsunami”. A large number of employees will begin retiring at a rapid rate in the next few years and the company wants to be prepared with the retirement packages, open positions and employees’ training. In order to ensure a smooth transition this analysis focuses on the following: 

1.	Identify the retiring employees by their title.
2.	Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
3.	Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program.
4.	Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department.
5.	Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation grouped by title and department.

## Deliverable 1:The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is crucial to creating a good database design. It is used as a high-level logical data model, which is useful in developing a conceptual design for databases.

**1.	The list of retiring employees**
-	The table includes employee number, first name, last name, title, from-date and to-date.
-	The query returns 133,776 rows. 
-	The table displays a list of employees who is going to retire in the next few years.
-	The list is long and extensive, yet at-a-glance analysis gives us some insights about the query. Some employees appear more than once due to change of title during their career at Pewlett-Hackard.
